# **UHD Student Resources**

## Inspiration
Why create this iOS application? Because there are resources available to students at the University of Houston - Downtown that are not accessible on a mobile device. Additionally, the existing application to provide mobile services is completely non-functional.

I work in IT at UHD, and I know that most students have questions about topics or services that could be easily provided inside of an application. Additionally, I have experience in creating mobile applications from the Mobile Computing class I took last semester.

## Acknowledgements
Thanks to Dr. Yuchou Chang for his patience and advice throughout the process. Big Nerd Ranch iOS Programming and Big Nerd Ranch Swift Programming books were very helpful in creating this project, along with Apple's guidelines and UHD's branding resources.

## Future Work
In the future this could be adapted to work with a variety of campuses and developed into a service that campuses can buy to aggregate mobile resources in one location. Additionally, more complex RSS handling and API handling need improvement for the future.
